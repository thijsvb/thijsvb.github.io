A stupid, ugly programmed, short Drawfee game. I'm sorry.
---
I made this game in one day, it doesn't have any music. 
I tried to do that but then I figuered this project wasn't worth the effort.
If you don't know [Drawfee](https://www.youtube.com/user/Drawfee), than don't bother trying to understand this game.
I know that it is very badly programmed, like I said in one day. I'm not planning on making it better.
You can download the game [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ovtmw86yr1sir3t/AABOFYVhy9MoDwnMiw_g7Smda?dl=0).
